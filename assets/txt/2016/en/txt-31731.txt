Declare by this Act that on 15 December of the year two thousand and fifteen a non-profit organization set up in
accordance with the law of June 27, 1921 and May 2, 2002 with the following statutes:
TITLE I: NAME, SEAT
Article 1 Name The association is called "Central Community 'association, abbreviated" CC "association.
Article 2, address: The seat of the association is located in the judicial district of Antwerp in 2000 ANTWERP,
ARSENAL STREET 5. The seat can be moved by decision of the General Assembly to any other address in
Belgium.
TITLE II: THE BASIS, AIMS, ACTIVITIES, RESOURCES, TIME
Article 3 Basis: The association takes the Bible as its foundation. She accepts the Bible as infallible, inspired by
God, fully reliable and therefore authoritative for the faith and action of man. This base serves as orientation for
the content, method and the definition of its activities and is detailed in the bylaws of the association.
Article 4 Objectives: The objectives of the association are inseparable from the foundation and is not able to join
in contradiction. The association serves as the legal entity for the Christian community that comes together at the
headquarters of the association, and for all its community activities arising directly or indirectly from the worship,
mutual care, education and service. The association will thus act within the Belgian government adopted in
recognition of the Administrative Council of the Protestant Evangelical Church Affairs for the implementation of
that worship.
